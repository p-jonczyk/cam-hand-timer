## INSTALLATION

**pip install -r *requirements.txt***
<br />

## ABOUT

Detection of hands with use of *mediapipe* and *opencv-python*. In addition program may count number of shown fingers *(for right hand)* and may play with you *rock/paper/scissors* live. 
<br />

*My first learning project with use of opencv and in generall image processing of any kind*
<br />

## KEY INFO

1. **PROGRAM RECOGNISE CHOICES (R/P/S) AND COUNT FINGERS ONLY FOR RIGHT HAND**
2. **PRESS 'Q' TO EXIT**
3. **RIGHT WAY TO SHOW R/P/S CHOICE**

## HOW TO
1. Download project / clone git. 
2. Make sure you made **INSTALLATION** step.
3. For counting fingers run: *fingers_couint.py*
4. For rock/paper/scissors run *rps_game.py*
